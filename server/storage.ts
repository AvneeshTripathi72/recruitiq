    excerpt: "Your CV is your first impression. Follow these expert tips to make recruiters take notice from line one.",
    content: `A strong CV is your ticket to landing an interview. In today's competitive job market, recruiters spend an average of just 7 seconds scanning each application — so yours needs to make an immediate impact.\n\nKeep it concise. Aim for 1–2 pages maximum, focusing only on experience and achievements relevant to the role you're applying for.\n\nUse strong action verbs. Begin each bullet point with words like "led," "delivered," "achieved," or "improved" to demonstrate impact rather than just listing responsibilities.\n\nQuantify your achievements. Numbers stand out. Instead of "managed a team," write "managed a team of 12 engineers, reducing delivery time by 30%."\n\nTailor every application. A generic CV rarely gets through. Read the job description carefully and mirror the language and priorities the employer uses.\n\nInclude relevant keywords. Many companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) that filter CVs before a human ever reads them. Include keywords from the job posting naturally throughout your CV.\n\nProofread ruthlessly. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors signal carelessness. Always have a second person review your CV before you submit.`,

    content: `The job market is evolving rapidly, and what employers want has shifted significantly over the past few years. While technical skills remain important, hiring managers are placing greater emphasis on a broader set of competencies.\n\n1. Adaptability. The ability to pivot quickly, learn new tools, and embrace change is now one of the most sought-after traits across every industry. Companies need people who thrive in uncertainty.\n\n2. Digital Literacy. Even in non-technical roles, comfort with digital tools, data analysis, and collaboration platforms is now expected. Familiarity with AI tools is a growing differentiator.\n\n3. Communication. Clear, concise communication — both written and verbal — remains a top priority. In hybrid and remote environments, the ability to articulate ideas clearly is more critical than ever.\n\n4. Problem-Solving. Employers want candidates who can identify issues, think critically, and propose practical solutions without needing constant guidance.\n\n5. Emotional Intelligence. The ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and empathise with colleagues and clients, is increasingly valued at all levels — especially in leadership roles.\n\nFocus your CV and interview preparation on demonstrating these competencies with concrete examples from your experience.`,

    content: `You've worked hard to get to the interview stage. Don't let a preventable mistake cost you the opportunity. Here are 15 things you should never do:\n\n1. Arrive late. Plan to arrive 10–15 minutes early. Account for traffic, parking, and reception delays.\n\n2. Fail to research the company. Not knowing the company's business, recent news, or culture signals a lack of genuine interest.\n\n3. Dress inappropriately. When in doubt, overdress. First impressions are visual.\n\n4. Speak negatively about past employers. It always reflects worse on you than on them.\n\n5. Check your phone. Put it on silent and keep it out of sight.\n\n6. Give vague, unprepared answers. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioural questions.\n\n7. Lie or exaggerate on your CV. Employers verify credentials, and dishonesty ends careers.\n\n8. Fail to prepare questions. "No questions" signals disinterest. Prepare 3–5 thoughtful questions.\n\n9. Forget to make eye contact. It builds trust and signals confidence.\n\n10. Ramble. Structure your answers, be concise, and know when to stop talking.\n\n11. Discuss salary too early. Wait until the employer raises compensation or you have an offer.\n\n12. Show desperation. Confidence and enthusiasm are attractive; desperation is not.\n\n13. Forget to bring copies of your CV. Always bring 2–3 printed copies.\n\n14. Overlook body language. Sit up straight, smile, and avoid crossing your arms.\n\n15. Forget to follow up. Send a brief, professional thank-you email within 24 hours.`,

    title: "Understanding Contract-to-Hire: Is It Right for You?",
    category: "Career Advice",
    excerpt: "Contract-to-hire roles offer flexibility and a trial period for both candidates and employers. Here's what you need to know.",
    content: `Contract-to-hire arrangements are becoming increasingly popular, especially in technology, finance, and specialised sectors. But what exactly are they, and should you consider one?\n\nWhat is contract-to-hire? A contract-to-hire role is a position where you initially work as a contractor for a defined period — typically 3 to 12 months — after which the employer has the option to convert you to a permanent employee.\n\nBenefits for candidates:\n- Try before you buy: You get to evaluate the company culture, team, and role before committing long-term.\n- Higher day rates: Contract roles often pay more per hour/day than equivalent permanent roles.\n- Faster start dates: Contract positions frequently have shorter hiring processes.\n- Skill building: Exposure to different environments accelerates your professional development.\n\nThings to consider:\n- Benefits uncertainty: You may not receive the same benefits (pension, healthcare) as permanent employees during the contract period.\n- Job security: If the role isn't converted, you'll need to find your next position.\n- Tax implications: Contracting has different tax obligations depending on your jurisdiction.\n\nOur advice: Contract-to-hire is an excellent option if you're open to evaluating a role before committing, or if you want to expand your experience across different organisations. Speak to a Tilcons consultant to find contract-to-hire roles that match your profile.`,

    title: "How to Negotiate Your Salary with Confidence",
    category: "Career Advice",
    excerpt: "Many candidates leave money on the table by not negotiating. Here's how to approach the conversation professionally.",
    content: `Salary negotiation is one of the most uncomfortable conversations for many candidates — but it's one of the most important. Studies consistently show that candidates who negotiate earn significantly more over their careers.\n\nDo your research first. Use salary benchmarking tools and industry reports to understand the market rate for your role, experience level, and location. Knowledge is your strongest asset in a negotiation.\n\nWait for the right moment. Let the employer make the first offer whenever possible. Once an offer is made, you have a baseline to work from.\n\nAnchor high, but be realistic. Counter with a number slightly above your target, giving yourself room to land where you want. Avoid lowballing yourself.\n\nFocus on total compensation. Salary is just one component. Consider bonus potential, equity, healthcare, pension, remote work flexibility, and professional development budget.\n\nBe professional and positive. Approach the conversation as a collaborative discussion, not a confrontation. Express gratitude for the offer and enthusiasm for the role before negotiating.\n\nPractice out loud. Rehearse the conversation so you feel confident when it matters. Role-play with a friend or career coach.\n\nKnow your walk-away number. Decide in advance the minimum you'll accept. If an offer falls below that, be prepared to decline respectfully.`,

    content: `The recruitment landscape is transforming faster than ever. Whether you're a hiring manager or a job seeker, understanding these trends will give you a competitive edge.\n\n1. Skills-based hiring is replacing degree requirements. More companies are removing degree requirements in favour of demonstrated skills and portfolios. This opens doors for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds.\n\n2. AI in recruitment is accelerating. Applicant tracking systems powered by AI are now screening CVs, scheduling interviews, and even conducting initial assessments. Candidates should optimise their CVs for ATS compatibility.\n\n3. Remote and hybrid work remains standard. Most professional roles now offer some form of flexible working. Candidates increasingly factor this into their decision-making.\n\n4. Speed is a competitive advantage. The best candidates are often off the market within 10 days. Companies with slow hiring processes lose top talent to faster-moving competitors.\n\n5. Employer brand matters more than ever. Candidates research companies thoroughly before applying. A strong online presence, positive reviews, and a clear value proposition are essential.\n\n6. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is a differentiator. Candidates — especially younger ones — prioritise employers who demonstrate genuine commitment to inclusive practices.\n\nFor employers, partnering with an experienced recruitment firm like Tilcons ensures you stay ahead of these trends and access top talent efficiently.`,
